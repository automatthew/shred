## Introduction

Shred is an HTTP client library for node.js that makes writing HTTP clients fun and easy.

    var Shred = require("shred");
		var shred = new Shred;
  
    shred.get({
      url: "http://api.spire.io/",
      headers: {
        accept: "application/json"
      },
      on: {
        // you can use response codes as events
        200: function(response) {
          console.log(response.content.data);
        },
        // any other response means something's wrong
        response: function(response) {
          console.log("Oh no!");
        }
      }
    });

The response was JSON, but Shred handles that for you because we specified `application/json` in the `Accept` header. So we're able to access it via `response.content.data`.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/spire-io/shred/wiki) for more examples.

Also, we wrote [a blog post][blog] on why we wrote Shred instead of going with existing libraries.
